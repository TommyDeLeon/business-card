# 📇 Project Documentation: Crafting a Digital Business Card 🚀

Welcome to the Frontend Career Path! I'm an Electronics Engineering student based in Rizal, Philippines, with a burning passion for electronics and technology. This digital business card is your gateway to connect with me and delve into my background. Let's embark on this journey together! 😊

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a beautiful blend of **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **Normalize.css** library. HTML is our canvas, structuring the content of the webpage, while CSS is our palette, styling the webpage to perfection. Normalize.css ensures that all elements are rendered consistently across different browsers.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of HTML, CSS, and digital design. We learned how to:
- Create a digital business card using HTML and style it using CSS 📇
- Use various CSS properties to style the card, including display: flex, justify-content, text-align, background, color, border-bottom, border-radius, background-size, font-family, font-size, padding, and CSS animations 🎨

## 🎨 What Was Created
We crafted a digital business card that displays a picture, name, profession, location, and a button to connect on LinkedIn. The card is styled to look professional and appealing, with a color scheme of #f5f1ed and #252323, and a pulsing animation on the button hover.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### Interactivity:
Our card is currently static. Adding some JavaScript could make it come alive. Imagine a modal popup with more information when the card is clicked! 🖱️
### Responsiveness:
Let's make our card adaptable to different screen sizes. Currently, it has a fixed size, which may not look good on all screens. Let's make connectivity accessible to everyone, regardless of their device! 📱
### Accessibility:
Let's ensure our card is accessible to all users. This could include using semantic HTML elements and adding appropriate alt text for the image. 🌐
